A web-based shopping platform that allows users to browse products, add items to a cart, and place orders. The project includes features like product filtering, user authentication, and responsive design. Built to simulate a real-world e-commerce experience from both user and QA perspectives.

As a QA, I worked on testing core functionality and also specific modules such as Cart and Registration. I designed test cases for key user scenarios and performed manual testing to ensure a smooth user experience.
